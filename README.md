# Minic
A simple chess engine to learn and play with.
Compatible with xboard/winboard.
Initially, the code size was supposed not go above 2000sloc.
Now that more features (especially SMP and bitboard) has come up, I'll try to keep it under 3000sloc.
This is why Minic stands for "Minimal Chess" (and is not related to the GM Dragoljub MiniÄ‡).

## Code style
Minic is (mainly) a one-file-code with very dense lines. This is of course very wrong in terms of software design... So why is it so? First reason is that Minic was first develop as a week-end project, the quick-and-dirty way, and since then I'm having fun going on this way ; being a "small" code size engine is part of the stakes in developing it. Second reason is that it helps the compilers optimize the whole code. The only dependency is the very good json header-only library nlohmann/json used to parse the config file. Some optional features such as Texel tuning, perft, tests, uci support, book generation ... are available in the Add-Ons directory.

## Release

WARNING : Dist directory as been REMOVED from the repository because it was starting to be too big. Unofficial releases are not available anymore. This operation has changed Minic git history, so you shall probably re-clone a clean repo.

Some stable/official ones will also be made available as github release. I "officially release" (create a github version) as sson as I have some validated elo (at least +10).

In a github release, a tester shall only use the given (attached) binaries. The full "source" package always contains everything (source code, test suites, opening suite, books, ...). If you want to use Minic parameter file (minic.json) or some given book file, there are not attached in all release, there are downloadable from the github repo.

Starting from release 0.50 new binaries are available :

```
* minic_0.50_linux_x64_avx2_bmi2    : fully optimized Linux64 (avx2+bmi2)   
* minic_0.50_linux_x64_sse4.2       : optimized Linux64 (sse4.2)  
* minic_0.50_linux_x64_x86-64       : basic Linux64  
* minic_0.50_mingw_x32_avx2_bmi2.exe: fully optimized Windows32 (avx2+bmi2)  
* minic_0.50_mingw_x32_sse4.2.exe   : optimized Windows32 (sse4.2)  
* minic_0.50_mingw_x32_i686.exe     : basic Windows32  
* minic_0.50_mingw_x64_avx2_bmi2.exe: fully optimized Windows64 (avx2+bmi2)  
* minic_0.50_mingw_x64_sse4.2.exe   : optimized Windows64 (sse4.2)  
* minic_0.50_mingw_x64_x86-64.exe   : basic Windows64   
```   

Please note that Win32 binaries are very slow (I don't know why yet, so please use Win64 one if possible).
   
## Strength
Minic 0.47 is 2650 on the CCRL 40/40 scale, so way to strong for me ! This is more or less like GM level for human being.

Minic finished 13/18 at TCEC16 qualification league (https://cd.tcecbeta.club/archive.html?season=16&div=ql&game=1)

Minic strength can be ajdusted using the level option (from command line or json configuration file). Level 0 is a random mover, 1 very weak, ..., level 10 is full strength. Level functionnaly will be enhanced in a near future.

Minic random mover stats are the following :

```
   7.73%  0-1 {Black mates}
   7.50%  1-0 {White mates}
   2.45%  1/2-1/2 {Draw by 3-fold repetition}
  21.99%  1/2-1/2 {Draw by fifty moves rule}
  54.16%  1/2-1/2 {Draw by insufficient mating material}
   6.13%  1/2-1/2 {Draw by stalemate}
```

Current level elo are more or less those :

## How to compile
* Linux : use the given build script (or make your own ...)
* Windows : use the given VS2017 project (or make your own ...), or use the Linux cross-compilation script given.

## How to run
add the command line option "-xboard" to go to xboard/winboard mode.

Other available options are :
* -perft_test : run the inner perft test
* -eval <"fen"> : static evaluation of the given position
* -gen <"fen"> : move generation on the given position
* -perft <"fen"> depth : perft on the given position and depth
* -analyze <"fen"> depth : analysis on the given position and depth
* -mateFinder <"fen"> depth : same as analysis but without prunings in search
* ...

## Options

Minic now comes with both a json configuration file where some parameters can be set
```
{
   "threads": 1,
   "mateFinder": false,
   "ttSizeMb": 1024,
   "book": true,
   "bookFile": "book.bin",
   "fullXboardOutput": true,
   "debugMode": false,
   "debugFile": "minic.debug",
   "level": 10,
   "syzygyPath": "/data/minic/TB/syzygy"
}

```
and a command line interface, using the same key word. For instance, forcing mateFinder mode can be done by adding "-mateFinder 1" when calling Minic.

## Syzygy EGT

To compile with SYZYGY support you'll need to clone https://github.com/jdart1/Fathom as Fathom directory and activate WITH_SYZYGY definition at compile time.
To use EGT just specify syzygyPath in the configuration file or in the command line.

## Opening books

Minic comes with some opening books written in an internal own binary format. There are currently 4 books
```
book_small : a very small book only with main variation of classic opening lines
book_big   : a bigger book (take 5 secondes to load) of nearly 400.000 lines
Carlsen    : based on Carlsen most used opening lines (thanks to Jonathan Cremers)
Anand      : based on Anand most used opening lines (thanks to Jonathan Cremers)
```

You can use both the json configuation file or the command line argument to select the book.

Many thanks also to all testers for all those long time control tests, they really are valuable inputs in the chess engine development process. 

Also thanks to TCEC for letting Minic participate to the Season 15 division 4a and Season 16 qualification league, it was fun to see Minic on such a great hardware.

And of course thanks to all the members of the talkchess forum and CPW, and to H.G. Muller for hosting the friendly monthly tourney.
