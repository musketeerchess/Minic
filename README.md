# Minic
A chess engine to learn and play with.
Compatible with both xboard/winboard and UCI.

## Code style
For a year and a half Minic was (mainly) a one-file-code with very dense lines. This is of course very wrong in terms of software design... So why is it so? First reason is that Minic was first developped as a week-end project (in mid-october 2018), the quick-and-dirty way, and since then I was having fun going on this way ; being a "small" code size engine was part of the stakes in developing it. Second reason is that it helps the compilers optimize the whole code (at least that is what I though... 

The only dependency is the very good json header-only library nlohmann/json used to parse the config file. Until version 2 of Minic, some optional features such as Texel tuning, perft, tests, uci support, book generation ... were available in the Add-Ons directory ; they are now fuse with the rest of the source code.

Indeed, since version "2" Minic is now written in a more classic c++ style, although very dense lines are still present and recall Minic past compacity...

## More history
Initially, the code size was supposed not go above 2000sloc. It started as a week-end project in october 2018 (http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=68701). But, as soon as more features (especially SMP and bitboard) has come up, I tried to keep it under 4000sloc and then 5000sloc. This is why this engine was named Minic, this stands for "Minimal Chess" (and is not related to the GM Dragoljub MiniÄ‡) but it has not much to do with minimalism anymore...  

Version "1" was release as a one year anniversary release in october 2019. At this point Minic has already go from a 1800 Elo 2-days-of-work engine, to a 2800 Elo engine being invited at TCEC qualification league.

Version "2" is release for April 1st 2020 (during covid-19 confinement). For this version, the one file Minic was splitted into many header and source files, and commented a lot more without negative impact on speed and strength. 

## Release process
WARNING : Dist directory as been REMOVED from the repository because it was starting to be too big. Unofficial releases are not available anymore. This operation has changed Minic git history, so you shall probably re-clone a clean repo. All (unofficial) releases are available in a new repo, here : https://github.com/tryingsomestuff/Minic-Dist

Some stable/official ones will also be made available as github release. I "officially release" (create a github version) as soon as I have some validated elo (at least +10).

In a github release, a tester shall only use the given (attached) binaries. The full "source" package always contains everything (source code, test suites, opening suite, books, ...). If you want to use Minic parameter file (minic.json) or some given book file, there are not attached in all release, there are downloadable from the github repo.

Starting from release 0.50 new binaries are available :

```
* minic_0.50_linux_x64_avx2_bmi2    : fully optimized Linux64 (avx2+bmi2)   
* minic_0.50_linux_x64_sse4.2       : optimized Linux64 (sse4.2)  
* minic_0.50_linux_x64_x86-64       : basic Linux64  
* minic_0.50_mingw_x32_avx2_bmi2.exe: fully optimized Windows32 (avx2+bmi2)  
* minic_0.50_mingw_x32_sse4.2.exe   : optimized Windows32 (sse4.2)  
* minic_0.50_mingw_x32_i686.exe     : basic Windows32  
* minic_0.50_mingw_x64_avx2_bmi2.exe: fully optimized Windows64 (avx2+bmi2)  
* minic_0.50_mingw_x64_sse4.2.exe   : optimized Windows64 (sse4.2)  
* minic_0.50_mingw_x64_x86-64.exe   : basic Windows64   
```   
Please note that Win32 binaries are very slow (I don't know why yet, so please use Win64 one if possible).
   
Starting from release 1.00 Minic support setting options using protocol (both XBoard and UCI). Option priority are as follow : json file, can be override by command line option, that can be override by protocol option.

```

Minic strength can be ajdusted using the level option (from command line, json configuration file, or using protocol option support, using value from 0 to 100). Level 0 is a random mover, 1 to 30 very weak, ..., level 100 is full strength. Level functionnaly will be enhanced in a near future.

Minic random-mover stats are the following :
```
   7.73%  0-1 {Black mates}
   7.50%  1-0 {White mates}
   2.45%  1/2-1/2 {Draw by 3-fold repetition}
  21.99%  1/2-1/2 {Draw by fifty moves rule}
  54.16%  1/2-1/2 {Draw by insufficient mating material}
   6.13%  1/2-1/2 {Draw by stalemate}
```

Current level elo are more or less so that even a kid can beat low levels Minic. From level 50 or 60, you will start to struggle more !

## How to compile
* Linux : use the given build script (or make your own ...)
* Windows : use the given VS2017 project (or make your own ...), or use the Linux cross-compilation script given.

## Syzygy EGT
To compile with SYZYGY support you'll need to clone https://github.com/jdart1/Fathom as Fathom directory and activate WITH_SYZYGY definition at compile time.
To use EGT just specify syzygyPath in the configuration file or in the command line.

## How to run
add the command line option "-xboard" to go to xboard/winboard mode or -uci for UCI.

Other available options are :
* -perft_test : run the inner perft test
* -eval <"fen"> : static evaluation of the given position
* -gen <"fen"> : move generation on the given position
* -perft <"fen"> depth : perft on the given position and depth
* -analyze <"fen"> depth : analysis on the given position and depth
* -qsearch <"fen"> : just a qsearch ...
* -mateFinder <"fen"> depth : same as analysis but without prunings in search
* -pgn <file> : extraction tool to build tuning data
* -texel <file> : run a texel tuning session
* ...

## Options

Minic now comes with both a json configuration file where some parameters can be set
```
{
   "threads": 1,
   "mateFinder": false,
   "ttSizeMb": 1024,
   "book": true,
   "bookFile": "book.bin",
   "fullXboardOutput": true,
   "debugMode": false,
   "debugFile": "minic.debug",
   "level": 100,
   "syzygyPath": "/data/minic/TB/syzygy"
}

```
and a command line interface, using the same key word. For instance, forcing mateFinder mode can be done by adding "-mateFinder 1" when calling Minic.

Starting from release 1.00, important options are also available through protocol.

## Opening books

Minic comes with some opening books written in an internal own binary format. There are currently 4 books
```
book_small : a very small book only with main variation of classic opening lines
book_big   : a bigger book (take 5 secondes to load) of nearly 400.000 lines
Carlsen    : based on Carlsen most used opening lines (thanks to Jonathan Cremers)
Anand      : based on Anand most used opening lines (thanks to Jonathan Cremers)
```

You can use both the json configuation file or the command line argument to select the book.

Many thanks also to all testers for all those long time control tests, they really are valuable inputs in the chess engine development process. 

Also thanks to TCEC for letting Minic participate to the Season 15 division 4a, Season 16 qualification league and Season 17 QL and L1, it was fun to see Minic on such a great hardware.

And of course thanks to all the members of the talkchess forum and CPW, and to H.G. Muller for hosting the friendly monthly tourney.
